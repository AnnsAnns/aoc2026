This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2026 challenge.

It is not really intended for public use, but I have made it open source so I can easily share it with friends.

The solutions are not optimized for performance or readability, as the main goal is to solve the puzzles as quickly as possible.

This means that some of the solutions may be messy or use brute-force methods, but they all work correctly for the given inputs.
